# zoom-attendance
A program to automatically take attendance during zoom classrooms.

This was made to help teachers at my school take attendance automaticaly rather than having to manually look through the participants list and compare it to the class roster. Unfortunately, due to limitations with authentication within my school's account, the project has been abandoned.
